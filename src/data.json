I have always had a knack for computers, but never explore the career field until taking a coding class in Java. This solidified my decision in going back to school for a Masters in Computer Science, and I’ve now worked in IT for two years. In continuing with my career growth, I am looking to further myself as a full stack developer and become immersed within the web development industry and set my path towards creating an emerging market combining both technology and architecture."]
